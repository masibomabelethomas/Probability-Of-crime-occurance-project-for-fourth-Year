# Probability of Crime Occurrence in Juja Subcounty
This repository contains the code and analysis for the fourth-year project titled "Probability of Crime Occurrence in Juja Subcounty." The project aimed to explore and model the likelihood of crime occurrence in Juja Subcounty using statistical techniques in R.

#Data Source
The data used for this project was obtained from Juja Police Station, providing valuable insights into historical crime occurrences in the area. The dataset includes various features such as time of occurrence, location, crime type, and time of the day, age of the person.

#Methodology
The analysis involved the use of Generalized Linear Models (GLM) in R to model the probability of crime occurrence. Initially, we attempted the Logit method, but due to specific characteristics of the data, we found the Probit family more suitable for the modeling task.

#Repository Structure
R/: Holds the R scripts for data processing, modeling, and visualization.

Usage
